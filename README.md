# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on building solutions that make learning easier and technology more accessible. Currently, I'm developing an LMS (Learning Management System) called EduFusion, tailored for IT companies offering educational services. My projects often involve a mix of cutting-edge technologies, creative problem-solving, and a touch of humor (I also run a TikTok channel about making funny sandwiches!).<br><br>What I'm Working On<br>- EduFusion LMS: A comprehensive LMS for IT companies, built using C# .NET 8, ASP.NET, Blazor, JavaScript (React), and MS SQL. This project includes features like role-based access, a detailed student workflow, and integration of Serilog for efficient logging. The front-end is crafted with Razor Pages and React to provide an engaging user experience.<br>- Authentication & Security: Implementing JWT-based authentication with a focus on user experience and security, such as integrating complex role management to handle different types of users (Admin, Manager, Teacher, Student, etc.).<br>- Database Management: Efficiently managing multiple databases, including one for logs and one for project entities. Extensive use of Dapper and EntityFrameworkCore to interact with SQL, alongside handling complex transactions and stored procedures.<br><br>Tech I Love Working With<br>- Languages: C#, JavaScript, SQL<br>- Frameworks & Tools: ASP.NET Core, Blazor, EntityFramework, Radzen, React, SignalR, Serilog<br>- Platforms: Ubuntu, TeamCity for CI/CD, Plex Media Server (Iâ€™m also a tech enthusiast at home!)<br><br>A Little About Me<br>I love exploring different areas of tech, from web development to server management. When I'm not coding, I'm probably messing around with Google TV, optimizing my Plex Media Server setup. I'm also a fan of abstract tattoos, especially ones inspired by Norse mythology and cosmic elements.
